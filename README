This repository includes a bunch of Python libraries used by my other repos,
or generally useful (or at least, I think so).

Short descriptions:
===================

CharDisplay.py -- given a character code as 999, 0xFFFF, 0177, etc., show a
ton of information about that Unicode code point.

ColorManager.py -- provides ANSI color control, interfaced via simple names
like red/white/bold (for bold red text on a white background).

DictTuple.py -- A subclass of dict that provides a number of features from defaultdict
    and namedtuple as well. It can even enforce types for members, allow or
    prohibit None for members, etc.

DomExtensions.py -- Everything you always wanted to have in DOM, but were afraid
to ask for. Has a method to monkey-patch it all onto a DOM implementation.

ElementManager.py -- Manage an XML schema (very basic)

EntityManager.py -- Manage XML data sources, catalogs, etc.

LooseDict.py -- A subclass of dict, that lets you attach a "normalization"
function for keys. For example, specifying lower() gives you a case-ignoring
dictionary. Each entry stores both the normalized and (last-set) unnormalized key.

MarkupHelpFormatter.py -- a limited text-formatter that can be attached to
Python argparse, so you can use MarkDown, POD, etc. to get reasonably-formatted help.

PowerWalk.py -- A much more flexible version of os.walk, that knows about
tar and zip files, filtering files by various criteria, etc.

ReadAny.py -- meh

RealDOM.py -- an implementation of DOM for Python. Renamed BaseDom.py, and
now moved to the XML/BINARY repo.

SimplifyUnicode.py -- meh

TabularFormats.py -- supports a load of "tabular" data formats, including many
variants of CSV. This started out as a port from Perl, but needs to be updated
so it sits on top of exiting Python libs where practical.

TabularFormats2.py -- in progress

Tokenizer.py -- a very Unicode-aware word tokenizer for NLP work.

TokensEN.py -- includable by Tokenizer.py to support English-specific stuff
like contractions.

UnicodeSpecials.py

XMLConstructs.py

XmlNlpLoad.py

XmlOutput.py -- helps you write well-formed XML with simple calls like OpenElement(name, attrs),
closeThroughElement(), and so forth. Maintains a stack so you know if you break things.

XmlTuples.py -- Supports a very simple, XML-conforming 3-element schema for
CSV-like data. Easily interconvertible with most any other such format.

alogging.py -- a logging package, mostly upwardly compatible with the usual Python
one, but handy for managing color, -v style message levels, auto-indentation, etc.

argParsePP.py -- half-done upgrade to argparse, for easier support of
-x vs. --x, --no-x, and other conventions.

improvements.py -- notes

markdownToXML.py -- what it says

mathUnicode.py -- provides somewhat easier access to the very many alternate
Latin and Greek alphabets in unicode, such as sans-serif bold.

sjdUtils.py -- very generally-applicable stuff, like indenting and escaping
and unescaping XML, JSON, etc; making Unicode and control characters printable, etc.
